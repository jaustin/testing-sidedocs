# Dance Steps
## What is it?
Use count-controlled loops and a sequence to help create a dance routine project on your BBC micro:bit. You can use the project alone or with friends.

# How it works
The program starts when you press button A.
Arrows appear on the micro:bit's LED display, which tell you how to dance – step left then right, put your hands up in the air, then point down to the floor.
If you are using the project in a group, everyone should press button A on their micro:bits at the same time, so that you start the dance routine at the same time and remain in sync.
After showing each image, the program pauses for a second (1000 milliseconds) before showing the next image. The pause helps everyone to keep in time.
The sequence of dance moves repeats four times then stops. The sequence is kept going using a count-controlled loop. Count-controlled loops repeat instructions a set number of times.
Using loops to keep things happening is an important idea in computer programming. This is also called iteration. 
When the routine is finished, the micro:bit's LED display is cleared.
